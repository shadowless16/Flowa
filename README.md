## 🎯 The Problem - Track: Payments Innovation (Challenge Eight)

**The Core Problem:** Digital payments are a utility - they just move money. But they happen at key moments in customers' lives: paying for dinner, splitting a bill, receiving a salary. We are missing the human context and the opportunity to add value.

**The Big Question:** How might we transform the simple act of payment into a smarter, more social, and more valuable experience for customers?

**Spark Questions We're Addressing:**
- ✅ What if a payment could trigger a savings action?
- ✅ How could we make splitting bills with friends fun and effortless?
- ✅ What tools could we build for a small business owner right inside their payment history?
